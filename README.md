# detector-readout

Utilities for interfacing with NISoC readout boards.

`Neutron_CLI.py` is the preferred utility to communicate with the readout. `Neutron_GUI.py` is a graphical alternative. `nisoc_readout.py` is a Python module implementing the communications protocol and available commands. `nisoc_readout_dummy.py` contains stub functions for testing readout front-ends.
